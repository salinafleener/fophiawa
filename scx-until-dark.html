Three criminals searching for a stash of heroin invade a blind woman‚Äôs apartment. Audrey Hepburn, more frantic than I‚Äôve ever seen her, plays the blind woman. A different kind of performance for her, usually she‚Äôs so bubbly and funny in romantic comedies. I thought she was great here. But Alan Arkin as one of the criminals really steals the show. He‚Äôs such a little weirdo. So the three criminals create this overly complicated, confusing roleplaying scheme to access the apartment.

The world is reeling from this information, but Sookie Yesterday I saw Wait Until Dark for the first time. Directed by Terence Young (Dr. No, From Russia with Love) and starring Audrey Hepburn and Alan Arkin. I highly recommend it. Great performance by Hepburn as a blind woman and Alan Arkin as an evil psychopath. A slow burn that by the final act you'll be as terrified as Susy Hendrix, Hepburn's character. Without giving anything away that final scene in the dark will hunt you well after the movie ends. 8/10 For those
